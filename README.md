<h1>SearchFilter table</h1>
It's a table with information about people and if you search the person AND the country,the result will show you the one you're looking for.
<h2>Strategy</h2>
In html I added the table and customized it with css.
In js,I wrote a function to get the value that the user searched first,then I uesd tolowerCase() so it will work in both ways the user searches.
after that I get the data from the rows and in a for with the length of each row,it will look for the match and hides the rest of the rows.
<h3>Note</h3>
if you open the code and add more information in the table and search for it,it will work properly.
